# CMSC2-3_Lab3

In this lab, you are introduced to multiple classes (a driver class and a data element class).  You will write the driver class in order to test the various methods provided in the data element class.  

You are given a file called Movie.java, which has the data fields for a movie, along with “setters” and “getters”, and a “toString” method.  You will create a driver class from the pseudocode in Task #1 below to test the Movie class.
